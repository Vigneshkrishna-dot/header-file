# Header File

This repository contains a simple C program demonstrating the usage of standard C header files: `<stdio.h>` and `<time.h>`. The program prints the current system time and measures the CPU time consumed by a dummy loop.

## Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    time_t t;
    time(&t);  // Get current time
    printf("Current Time: %s", ctime(&t));

    clock_t start = clock();  // Start CPU clock
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++); // Dummy loop
    clock_t end = clock();
    printf("CPU Time used: %f seconds\n", (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

- `time()`  
  Returns the current system time as a `time_t` object.

- `ctime()`  
  Converts a `time_t` value to a readable string format representing the local time.

- `clock()`  
  Measures the amount of CPU time consumed since the start of the program. Useful for benchmarking code execution time.

## Output Example

```
Current Time: Wed Aug 20 17:31:34 2025
CPU Time used: 0.020000 seconds
```

## How to Compile and Run

1. Save the program to a file, for example, `header_example.c`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the file location.
3. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```
   gcc header_example.c -o header_example
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./header_example
   ```
